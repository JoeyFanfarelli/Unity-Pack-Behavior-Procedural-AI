# Unity-Pack-Behavior-Simple-AI
 NPCs flee from the player. When they see another NPC, they form a pack (if none exists) or join their pack. If the NPC's pack has less than two members, they still flee. At 2 and 3, they ignore the player. Above 3, they chase the player. Raycasts are used in conjunction with overlapshere for npc vision. Script of interest is NPCMovement.
